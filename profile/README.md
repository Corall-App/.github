**Corall Social** is a modern communication initiative focused on building **secure, private, and human-centered messaging solutions**.
We design tools that make digital conversations seamless, safe, and accessible â€” for individuals, teams, and communities.

## What We Build

* **Corall Social** â€“ our flagship social networking service, combining speed, security, and simplicity.

## Why Corall?

Most messengers today force a trade-off between **usability, privacy, and trust**.
Corall is designed to remove that compromise:

* End-to-end encryption by default
* Lightweight, modern UX
* Transparent development & open-source values
* Built to scale from private chats to large communities

**Corall isnâ€™t just another messaging app â€” itâ€™s a communication ecosystem that respects users first.**
